# Project Boilerplate Specification

This specification describes the structure and components required for a baseline project boilerplate. The goal is to minimize repetitive setup when initiating a new web application project. By duplicating this repository, you should have a working starting point with common tools, configurations, and scripts already in place.

## Overview

The boilerplate provides a foundation for both frontend and backend development. It ensures modern standards, security, performance considerations, testing, and documentation capabilities are ready out-of-the-box.

## Core Features

- **Frontend Stack**:  
  - TypeScript for strongly typed development.  
  - Web Components as a framework-agnostic approach for UI.  
  - FAST Element & Fluent UI Web Components (v3) for standard UI components.  
  - Vite for fast development and efficient bundling.  
  - Universal Router for client-side routing.  
  - Tailwind CSS for rapid styling.  
  - Zod for runtime schema validation.

- **Backend Stack**:  
  - Node.js (LTS) as the runtime environment.  
  - Fastify for a performant and extensible HTTP server.  
  - Prisma as the ORM for database interactions.  
  - PostgreSQL as the primary database.  
  - Helmet.js and compression middleware for security and performance.  
  - Basic CORS, Content Security Policy, and rate-limiting configurations.

- **Development Tools**:  
  - pnpm as the package manager.  
  - ESLint + Prettier for code quality and formatting.  
  - Vitest for unit testing.  
  - Playwright for end-to-end testing.  
  - GitHub Actions for continuous integration.  
  - JSDoc + TypeDoc for generating developer documentation.

- **Implementation Considerations**:  
  - CORS configuration pre-enabled.  
  - CSP setup for enhanced security.  
  - Rate limiting to prevent abuse.  
  - Image optimization and lazy loading for performance.  
  - Code splitting for scalable frontend delivery.

## Optional Capabilities (Commented Out)

The boilerplateâ€™s configuration files should list optional packages without installing them, making it easy to integrate additional features later by simply uncommenting the relevant dependencies. These optional capabilities include:

- **PWA & Offline**: Vite PWA plugin, Workbox, Service Workers, PWA manifests, and caching strategies for offline support.
- **AI/ML Stack**: LangChain.js, ChromaDB, Pinecone Vector Database, OpenAI GPT-4, embeddings, and Hugging Face Transformers for AI-driven features.
- **Performance & Scaling**: Redis for caching and Docker for containerization.
- **Authentication & Security**: JWT, OAuth 2.0, OIDC support.
- **Development & Testing Enhancements**: MSW for mocking APIs.
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger generation and UI.
- **Observability & Monitoring**: OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana for metrics; Sentry and DataDog for error tracking and performance insights.

## Directory Structure

- **/src/frontend**: Contains the frontend entry points, components, and related assets.
- **/src/backend**: Contains server code, routes, plugins, and Prisma schema files.
- **/src/shared**: Utilities, types, and other shared code used across frontend and backend.
- **/src/tests**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests.
- **/public**: Publicly accessible static assets.
- **/.github/workflows**: CI configuration files.
- **Configuration Files**: Include tsconfig, ESLint, Prettier, Vite config, and other essential config files in the project root.

## Required Scripts

- **dev**: Starts local development servers (frontend and backend as needed).
- **build**: Produces a production-ready build of the frontend (and potentially backend).
- **preview**: Previews the production build locally.
- **start**: Runs the built backend server in production mode.
- **test**: Runs unit and integration tests.
- **test:ui**: Executes end-to-end tests.
- **lint**: Checks code quality with ESLint.
- **format**: Formats code with Prettier.
- **docs**: Generates documentation from source comments.

## CI/CD Integration

Use GitHub Actions to automate testing, linting, and building on each push or pull request. Adjust the CI pipeline to add more steps as the project grows.

## Documentation

Use JSDoc and TypeDoc to generate reference documentation. Maintain a README and high-level architecture overview to guide new contributors and explain design decisions.

This specification ensures a new project starts with a robust, modern, and maintainable configuration. Optional features can be integrated easily, reducing initial complexity while preserving flexibility.
