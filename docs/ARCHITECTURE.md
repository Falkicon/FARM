# Architecture Documentation

## Overview
This project is a modern web application using:
- Lit for frontend components
- Fastify for backend API
- TypeScript throughout
- Vite for development and building
- 
- Containerization
-   - Docker for containerization
-   - Docker Compose for local development
-

## Development Setup
To run the application:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start development servers: `npm run dev`
-   - Alternatively, use Docker: `docker-compose up`

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── frontend/        # Client-side application
├── backend/         # Server-side application
└── shared/          # Shared code between front/backend
```

## Key Design Patterns

### Component-Based Architecture
- Web Components using Lit
- Reusable UI components
- Feature-based organization
- Shared component library

### Feature-First Organization
- Self-contained features
- Independent routing
- Isolated business logic
- Feature-specific components

### State Management
- Component-level state
- Service-based data management
- Event-driven communication
- Type-safe interfaces

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints
- Type-safe requests/responses
- OpenAPI documentation
- Proper error handling

## Data Flow

1. User Interaction
   - Component events
   - Route changes
   - Form submissions

2. Data Management
   - API requests
   - Data validation
   - Error handling
   - State updates

3. Backend Processing
   - Request validation
   - Business logic
   - Database operations
   - Response formatting

## Security Considerations

- CORS configuration
- Helmet security headers
- Input validation
- Authentication/Authorization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

## Performance Optimization

- Component-level monitoring
- Lazy loading
- Code splitting
- Caching strategies
- Database indexing

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- E2E tests
- Performance testing
- Accessibility testing

## Deployment

- CI/CD pipeline
- Environment configuration
- Database migrations
- Monitoring setup
- Logging strategy

## Development Workflow

1. Feature Development
   - Create feature branch
   - Implement components
   - Write tests
   - Document changes

2. Code Review
   - Automated checks
   - Peer review
   - Performance review
   - Security review

3. Deployment
   - Staging deployment
   - Testing verification
   - Production release
   - Monitoring
