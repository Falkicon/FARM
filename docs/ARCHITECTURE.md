# Architecture Documentation

## Overview
This project is a modern web application using:
- Lit for frontend components and UI
- Fastify for backend API
- TypeScript throughout
- Vite for development and building
- TailwindCSS for styling

### Planned Enhancements
- Docker containerization for consistent environments
- OpenAPI documentation for API exploration
- Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline
- Multi-layer caching strategy

## Development Setup
To run the application:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start development servers: `npm run dev`

### Planned Development Features
```bash
# Future Docker support
docker-compose up   # Start all services
docker-compose up frontend  # Start only frontend
docker-compose up backend   # Start only backend
```

## Key Design Patterns

### Component-Based Architecture
- Web Components using Lit
- Reusable UI components
- Feature-based organization
- Shared component library

### Feature-First Organization
- Self-contained features
- Component-based routing
- Isolated business logic
- Feature-specific components

### State Management
- Component-level state using Lit decorators
- Service-based data management
- Event-driven communication
- Type-safe interfaces

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints
- Type-safe requests/responses
- Fastify schema validation
- Proper error handling

#### Planned API Enhancements
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- API versioning
- Rate limiting middleware
- Response caching layer

## Data Flow

1. User Interaction
   - Component events
   - Route changes
   - Form submissions

2. Data Management
   - API requests
   - Data validation
   - Error handling
   - State updates

3. Backend Processing
   - Request validation
   - Business logic
   - Response formatting

### Planned Caching Strategy
- Browser-level caching
- Service worker caching
- API response caching
- Static asset optimization

## Security Considerations

- CORS configuration
- Helmet security headers
- Input validation
- XSS protection
- Content Security Policy
- Rate limiting

### Planned Security Enhancements
- API key management
- Request signing
- Enhanced rate limiting
- Security headers audit

## Performance Optimization

- Component-level monitoring
- Lazy loading
- Code splitting
- Performance metrics tracking
- Memory usage monitoring

### Planned Performance Features
- Automated performance budgets
- Real-user monitoring (RUM)
- Lighthouse CI integration
- Bundle size monitoring

## Testing Strategy

- Component tests
- Integration tests
- E2E tests using Playwright
- Performance testing
- Accessibility testing

### Planned Testing Enhancements
- Visual regression testing
- Load testing
- Security scanning
- API contract testing

## Development Workflow

1. Feature Development
   - Create feature branch
   - Implement components
   - Write tests
   - Document changes

2. Code Review
   - Automated checks
   - Peer review
   - Performance review
   - Security review

3. Deployment
   - Testing verification
   - Production release
   - Health monitoring
   - Status checks
